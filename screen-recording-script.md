# Screen Recording Script — 15s Apple-Style Trailer

**Length:** 15 seconds  
**Vibe:** Apple product trailer — minimal, confident, one idea per shot. No clutter.

---

## Look & feel

- **Typography:** One word or short phrase per card. Heavy weight, lots of negative space. SF Pro / system font or clean geometric sans. White on dark or black on light; no gradients.
- **Pacing:** 2–3 second beats. Snap cuts. No transitions except a simple cut or brief fade to black before the end card.
- **Motion:** Smooth. Slight speed ramp (e.g. 0.9× then 1.1×) on scroll; hold the “hero” frame for a moment. Cursor moves deliberately or hide it.
- **Audio:** Minimal. One subtle track (ambient or single-note), or silence. No voiceover.
- **Frame:** 1080p, 30fps. Browser full-screen, clean. Consider recording at 1080×1920 for vertical (Stories/Reels) and crop to 16:9 for feed.

## Script (15 seconds)

| Time | Shot | Action | On-screen text |
|------|------|--------|----------------|
| **0:00–0:02** | Hero | Site already loaded. Portfolio view, hero in frame. Still or very slow scroll. | *(none)* or **Portfolio** — center, large |
| **0:02–0:05** | Scroll + dock | One smooth scroll down. Stop when floating dock (Experience • Work • Skills • Contact) is visible. | **Scroll.** — then cut |
| **0:05–0:07** | Switch | Click mode toggle → Workstation. 3D scene + terminal fill frame. | *(none)* |
| **0:07–0:10** | Themes | Open theme picker. Snap cut: **Light** → **CRT** (hold 1s) → **Sky** (hold 1s). | **Themes.** — center, 1s |
| **0:10–0:13** | Terminal | Cursor in terminal. Type `run` + Enter. Output appears. | **Terminal.** — center, 1s |
| **0:13–0:15** | End card | Cut to black (or freeze last frame). Single line, center. | **jalenedusei.com** |

## Shot details

1. **0:00–0:02** — Start with the page already open (edit out loading in post). Portfolio hero visible. No cursor movement or one slow move. Feels like a product hero shot.

2. **0:02–0:05** — One continuous scroll. Speed ramp in edit: ease in, ease out. Last frame: dock clearly visible. Text “Scroll.” can appear at 0:02 and disappear at 0:04, or stay until the cut.

3. **0:05–0:07** — Click toggle. Cut as soon as Workstation is fully in frame. No text here—the 3D + terminal is the message.

4. **0:07–0:10** — Theme picker open. Three cuts: current theme → CRT (green) → Sky (blue). Each cut on the beat. “Themes.” on screen for ~1 second, then off. Or no text.

5. **0:10–0:13** — Terminal in focus. Type `run` clearly. Cut when the list is visible. “Terminal.” can appear at 0:10, off by 0:12.

6. **0:13–0:15** — Hard cut to black. One line: **jalenedusei.com**. Hold 2 seconds. Optional: very short fade in of the URL.

## Pre-production

- **Record:** 1080p, 30fps. Close all other tabs; hide bookmarks bar; use a neutral new-tab page if the URL is shown.
- **Cursor:** Either smooth and minimal or hidden in post. No accidental moves.
- **Prep:** Have the site open on Portfolio view before you hit record. Optional: pre-record each beat separately and cut in post for perfect timing.

## Edit notes (Apple-style)

- No transition effects. Straight cuts only (except optional 0.5s fade up on the end card).
- Text cards: 1–1.5 seconds on screen. Center frame. Plenty of padding so the type breathes.
- If you use music: one continuous bed, no drops or hits—keeps it calm and premium.
- Export: H.264, 1080p, 30fps. For LinkedIn, stay within their length and file-size limits.

**One-line pitch:** *Portfolio and 3D Workstation in 15 seconds — minimal, Apple-style.*
